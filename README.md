# water-bucket-dialima
Ever heard of the 3 litre and 5 litre bucket riddle? This python script will brute force all the possible actions (fill, spill, transfer water and dump displaced water) and spit out a solution. Usually it gives thousands of steps but use the last couple steps to solve the riddle in a reasonable time span.
